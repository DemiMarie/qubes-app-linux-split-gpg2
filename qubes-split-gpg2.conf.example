[DEFAULT]
# 'autoaccept' option - for how long automatically accept requests from the
# same client qube; accepted values:
#  - no - do not automatically accept, prompt each time
#  - yes - always automatically accept, never prompt
#  - seconds - number of seconds for how long automatically accept further requests
#  of the same type
#
# default:
# autoaccept = no

# 'pksign_autoaccept' option - same as 'autoaccept' but only for signing requests
# 'pkdecrypt_autoaccept' option - same as 'autoaccept' but only for decrypt requests
# Note that signing and decrypt requests may be indistinguishable for some key types.

# 'verbose_notifications' option - show extra notifications
# accepted values: yes, no
#
# default:
# verbose_notifications = no

# 'allow-keygen' option - allow generating new keys
# accepted values: yes, no
#
# default:
# allow_keygen = no

# 'gnupghome' option - set alternative GnuPG home directory; empty value means
# GnuPG's default. This option takes precedence over 'isolated_gnupghome_dirs'.
# accepted values: full path to the GuPG homedir;
#
# default:
# gnupghome =

# 'isolated_gnupghome_dirs' option - use separate GnuPG home directory for each
# client (calling qube). The value points at a directory where each client will
# get its own subdirectory. For example when this option is set to
# '/home/user/gpg-home', then qube 'personal' will use
# /home/user/gpg-home/personal as GnuPG home.
#
# default:
# isolated_gnupghome_dirs =

# 'debug_log' option - enable debug logging and set the debug log path
# This is for debugging purpose only EVERYTHING WILL BE LOGGED including
# potentially confidential data/keys/etc.
#
# default:
# debug_log =

# 'source_keyring_dir' option - use a different source keyring.  If not set,
# the default is to use the home directory computed above.  Secret subkeys (but
# *not* the main key!) will be imported from this directory to the directory
# 'qubes-auto-keyring' under the home directory.  Set this to 'no' to
# disable the feature and give clients access to all secret keys.  This
# is not recommended as it allows clients to sign other OpenPGP keys.
#
# default: (not set)

# Each config option can be also set for specific client qube only, by putting
# it in a "client:<name>" section. For example, to automatically accept all
# requests from a qube named "trusted", add section like this:
#
# [client:trusted]
# autoaccept = yes
